This is a general guide and not a prescription, every data set is unique. 

When problems appear it takes inqenuity, finesse, and often experience to figure out what is happening.


## ** GETTING TO KNOW WHAT YOUR ARE LOOKING AT **
- What genotyping technology and platform do you have ?
  -  Sequencing
  -  Array
     -  Affymetrix
     -  Illumina
 - It is reasonable to expect data are delivered to you in a common format such as PLINK format, VCF, or BCF.
 - Within days (as soon as possible) of getting the data set:
    - Check that you can open the files. Corruption of files often happens during file transfer.
    - Read through any documentation provided.
      - Most facilities perfoem some basic quality control but may give you potentially problematic data.
      - Find out what control samples are included.
